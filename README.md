Little Immune is a mobile application developed to increase child vaccination rates and ensure timely vaccination of children in India. The app aims to help parents to keep track of their child's vaccine schedules, send timely reminders, and educate them about the importance of vaccination.

Need and Importance in India Today:
Vaccination is critical to public health in India, and the need for a Vaccine Reminder App is more important now than ever before.

Here are some reasons why:

Large Population: India has a population of over 1.3 billion, and it can be challenging to keep track of who needs to be vaccinated and when. A vaccine reminder app can help make the vaccination process more efficient and ensure that every child gets vaccinated on time.

COVID-19 Pandemic: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination is critical to mitigating the spread of the virus. A vaccine reminder app can help individuals keep track of their COVID-19 vaccine schedules and ensure that they get vaccinated on time.

Vaccine Hesitancy: Parents may be hesitant to get vaccinated due to fear or misinformation. A vaccine reminder app can help educate them about the benefits of vaccination and encourage them to get their child vaccinated.

Convenience: A vaccine reminder app can make the process of scheduling and receiving vaccinations more convenient for parents. They can receive reminders about their appointments and track their vaccine history, making it easier to keep up with their vaccination schedule.

Overall, the need and importance of a Vaccine Reminder App in India today cannot be overstated. It can play a crucial role in increasing vaccination rates, mitigating the spread of COVID-19, reducing vaccine hesitancy, and improving public health in India.
